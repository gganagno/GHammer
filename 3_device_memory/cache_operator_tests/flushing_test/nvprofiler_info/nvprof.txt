The nvprof profiling tool enables you to collect and view profiling data from the command-line.
nvprof enables the collection of a timeline of CUDA-related activities on both CPU and GPU, including kernel execution, memory transfers, memory set and CUDA API calls and events or metrics for CUDA kernels. 
Profiling options are provided to nvprof through command-line options. 
Profiling results are displayed in the console after the profiling data is collected, and may also be saved for later viewing by either nvprof or the Visual Profiler.
