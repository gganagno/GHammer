# GHammer
A GPGPU Rowhammer Attack
A vastly known software-initiated fault attack is the so-called Rowhammer. Rowhammer is a side effect in Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) that causes a charge leak to memory cells, which can eventually alter the contents of adjacent memory cells that were not
even addresse. In GHammer,we examine the feasibility of the Rowhammer attack in GPGPU hardware architectures and provide insight regarding our results.
